# PDF Data Extractor and Summarizer

This project is a Python script (`extractor.py`) that extracts structured data and generates summaries from PDF files placed in a designated folder (`files_to_extract`).

## How to Run

### 1. Setup a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the same directory as the script.
2.  Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file as follows:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

### 4. Place PDFs in the Input Folder

1.  Create a folder named `files_to_extract` in the same directory as the script.
2.  Place all the PDF files you want to process into this folder.

### 5. Run the Script

Execute the `extractor.py` script from your terminal:

```bash
python extractor.py
```

## Output

After the script runs successfully, it will process each PDF in the `files_to_extract` folder and produce a set of output files for each one, prefixed with the original PDF's filename:

- `<pdf_filename>_output.json`: Contains the structured data extracted from the main PDF form.
- `<pdf_filename>_attachment_summary.txt`: A summary of the content found in the attachment pages of the PDF.
- `<pdf_filename>_summary.txt`: The final, combined summary generated by the AI, incorporating details from both the form and the attachments.

The script will also print the extracted data and summaries to the console during execution for each file it processes.
