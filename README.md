# PDF Data Extractor and Summarizer

This project is a Python script (`extractor.py`) that extracts structured data and generates summaries from a PDF file (`Form ADT-1-29092023_signed.pdf`).

## How to Run

### 1. Setup a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the same directory as the script.
2.  Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file as follows:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

### 4. Run the Script

Execute the `extractor.py` script from your terminal:

```bash
python extractor.py
```

## Output

After the script runs successfully, it will produce the following files:

- `output.json`: Contains the structured data extracted from the main PDF form.
- `attachment_summary.txt`: A summary of the content found in the attachment pages of the PDF.
- `summary.txt`: The final, combined summary generated by the AI, incorporating details from both the form and the attachments.

The script will also print the extracted data and summaries to the console during execution.
